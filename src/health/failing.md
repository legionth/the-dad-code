# Failing

We will fail as dads. We will yell at our kids and we will be unfair to them.
We will be tired and we will be angry.

We will fail as fathers, but the important thing is to reflect on our behaviour and repair the damage we did.

These are no execuses for our behaviour, but we are humans, and we make mistakes.

I often feel like failure because I was unfair to my kids. I yelled at them, because I was tired or angry.
But I always try to reflect on my behaviour. 

```
Why was I angry? 

Was it because we would be late for kindergarten?

Was I angry because I was afraid other parents would judge me?
```

Anger is probably a big male problem. In western society it was for years the only emotion that were acceptable for boys.
You fell like crying? - No, you have to be strong.
You feel confused? - No, you have to find it out by yourself.
You feel hurt? - No, put some dirt on it and go on.
You feel angry? - Yes, that is the right emotion.

That is no execuse for our behaviour, but it is probably one of many reasons to explain the behaviour of man
Always remember, that you if you do damage on their mental well-being, you have to repair it.
Sit down with your kids and talk about it.
Try to explain your behaviour and make it clear that you were not right to behave like that.

## Trying to break the cycle

We all have something we try to break with in our family history.

My father always helped in the household. Cleaning, Cooking, Washing etc..
Something my grandfather rarely did.
My father was often exhausted after work to play with us.
Something I would like to break. 
I try to sit there and play with them.
Even if think it is the most boring thing in the world.
They love it and that is more important than my current boredom.
