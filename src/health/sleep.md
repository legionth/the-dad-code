## Family bed

The family bed is a bed large enough for the whole family.
This can be multiple different beds or a big bed.
We have a big bed and a small bed in our bedroom.
The small bed is for the kids and the big bed is for us.

So why do we have a family bed?
It is very easy: The kids sleep better, and we sleep better.

In western societies, it is common to have separate rooms for the kids.
But this is not the case in all societies.

We are mammals and mammals sleep together.
10.000 years ago, the kids slept beside their parents and their tribe.

The most important thing is that the parents don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, and don't take drugs.
This can be dangerous for the kids, because under the influence of these substances, the parents can't react properly in a sleeping state.
