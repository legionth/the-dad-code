# Sleep

Sleep is very individual and everybody has different needs.
In this chapter, I'll try to explain how we manage the sleep of our kids and ourselves.

## Family bed

_Attention: Newborns have special needs: no blankets, no pillows and a separate area for themselves.
Otherwise, the danger of suffocation is really high_

The family bed is a bed large enough for the whole family.
This can be multiple different beds or a big bed.
We have a big bed and a small bed in our bedroom.
The small bed is for the kids and the big bed is for us.

So why do we have a family bed?
It is very easy: The kids sleep better, and we sleep better.

In western societies, it is common to have separate rooms for the kids.
But this is not the case in all societies.

We are mammals and mammals sleep together.
10.000 years ago, the kids slept beside their parents and their tribe.

The most important thing is that the parents don't drink alcohol, don't smoke, and don't take drugs.
This can be dangerous for the kids, because under the influence of these substances, the parents can't react properly in a sleeping state.

The second most important thing that everybody feels comfortable.
Don't force your kids to sleep in the family bed.
Every body should feel comfortable and safe and if not, you should find another solution.

## Sleep training

Sleep training is a scam.

You can't teach newborns or little babies to sleep.
They are learning how to walk, speak and eat, mostly by themselves.
And we try to intervene, because it is not convenient for our working hours?

Kids have a natural sleep rhythm, and you have to find out what works for you.

For example, our oldest child slept till 9am-10am in the morning, took a 1h nap at 2pm and
gone to bed at 10pm-11pm, when we also went to bed.
It changed when he was 2.5 years and didn't need a nap anymore and had
to go to kindergarten at 9am. So he had to change his rhythm and wakes up at 8am and goes to bed at 8pm.

Don't force your kids to sleep, they will sleep when they are tired.
Try to find a rhythm that works for you and your kids.

Funny fact: Sleep training emerged in the 19th century, when the industrial revolution started.
Parents had to work in factories and the kids had to sleep at a certain time.
