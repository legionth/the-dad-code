## Learning tower

So the first thing you have to manage is the height of your kids.
They are small and can't reach the kitchen counter.
So you have to get them up to the right height.
You could use a chair or a stool, but that's not very safe.
So I would recommend a learning tower.

A learning tower is a stool with a safety bar around it.
So your kids can't fall out of it, but they can climb in and still reach the counter.
