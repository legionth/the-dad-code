# Cooking


## Learning tower

So the first thing you have to manage is the height of your kids.
They are small and can't reach the kitchen counter.
So you have to get them up to the right height.
You could use a chair or a stool, but that's not very safe.
So I would recommend a learning tower.

A learning tower is a stool with a safety bar around it.
So your kids can't fall out of it, but they can climb in and still reach the counter.

## Cutting

A big part of cooking is cutting vegetables and meat.
In my opinion, you can't start early enough with this.
Of course, you need to have safe knives, but you also
have to switch to the sharp ones as soon as possible.
Remember, we are here to teach our kids the basics of life.
And cutting your food is one of them.

As you can see on the photo, you can start with some kids knives.
These are perfect for cutting soft vegetables like cucumbers, tomatoes or zucchini.
