# Bonding

I found bonding with my kids a bit more difficult than my wife.
Due to the pregnancy, the mother has a head start.
Mothers feel their children grow inside them, and they have a connection from the beginning.
We dads have to work a bit harder to get that connection.

Bonding is the connection between you and your child. How you feel about each other.
How you interact with each other. How you care for each other.

I struggled at the beginning:
I want to share here what helped me.

## Bonding during pregnancy

This was for me a very weird period. 
I had to talk to someone who wasn't there.
Well he was there, but I couldn't see him.
Also, someone else was also listening to me, my wife.

For me this was really weird.
And it's okay to feel weird about it, but I recommend to talk to your baby nonetheless.

I didn't do this on our firstborn, but I did it on our second.
And I have to say, you definitely feel a difference, a deeper connection at the beginning.

But you can also bond with your baby by touching your wife's belly.
You can feel the baby moving and kicking.

## Bonding after birth

Bonding after birth can also be hard for us fathers.
Often the mother is required for feeding the baby in the first months, they often get easier soothe
the baby and they have a stronger connection due to the pregnancy.

We dads need keep up with the bonding.

So what can we do?

Change diapers is a good start.
This is an easy pick.
You have the touching part of bonding naturally by changing the diaper.
But you could also talk to your baby while changing the diaper.

I had the problem that I didn't know what to talk about.
So I started to talk about my work, my day, my plans.
What I want to eat, what I want to do.
Talk about sports, talk about the weather.
Talk about anything, just start talking.

Don't like the smell? Me neither. I almost threw up
for half a year if it has been number two.

What else can you do?
Go for a walk with your baby. Show them stuff in the neighborhood.
I know they can't see that far, but they can hear, smell and feel.

You have to get creative and active. They won't initiate the bonding, you have to.

## Bonding with toddlers

Most dads have a better connection with their kids when they are toddlers.
Why because they can interact with you. And they are more robust, so you can wrestle on the bed or on the couch.
You can chase them around the house, you can play hide and seek.

You can also read books to them.
