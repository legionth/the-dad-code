# Birth

## Be there

Your wife needs support during birth.
Even if you think you can do nothing, you can be there.
Help her with the breathing, hold her hand, and just be there.

There will be scary situations, but it is even more scary for your wife.
Be there, help with decisions, if she can't make them. But be sure that you are on the same page.
Talk to your wife, before you go to the hospital, about the birth plan.
* Do you want a natural birth?
* Is a C-section an option?
* What about pain relief?
* Who is allowed to be in the room?
* Who is allowed to hold the baby first?
* What is allowed to do with the baby after birth? Holding? Skin to skin contact?
  * Btw. kisses in the first days are a very bad idea. Your baby has no immune system and you can transfer bacteria and viruses to your baby. Which can become critical very quickly.

Talk with your wife, if possible. If not, try to remember what she wanted.

## Skin to skin contact

The best way to bond early with your child is skin to skin contact.
Don't wear any perfume or deodorant, just be you.
Your baby can't see very far and clearly, but they can smell you.

It's the earliest way to [bond](/src/health/bonding.md) with your child, so just do it.

## Courses

You can probably find a lot of birth preparation courses in your area.
I can only recommend to go there.
You learn a lot about the birth process, what to expect, and how to help your wife.

It also helps to meet other parents, who are in the same situation as you.
And lower the fear of the unknown.
