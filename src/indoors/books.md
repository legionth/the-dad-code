# Books

My kids love books. Of course I'm writing about the children books. Not much text and a lot of pictures. But they love them.

## Concentration

Let's be honest, kids can't concentrate for long. So we have to keep it short and simple.
That is why we started with short stories. Books that are over in 5 minutes or less.
They jump around, they want to turn the pages, they want to talk about the pictures.

What we do is, we let them.

We ask them if they want to continue or if they want to stop and respect their decision.
Remember, that you would also put down a book if you don't like it or currently not in the mood.

The important thing is to read to them and try to repeat it.

## Goodnight Stories

Goodnight stories are a good way to end the day. We have a routine that we read a book (or two, or three...) before we go to bed.
For us it works like a charm. The kids know that after the book, they have to go to bed.
Sometimes they ask for more books, and sometimes they don't.

## Library

Looking for books but you don't know if your kids like them?
Get a library card and borrow some books.
Take your kids with you and let them choose the books.

And if they really likes them, you can buy them afterwards.

The great thing about the library is, you automatically have a new place to
go and your kids can explore this new environment.
Local libraries also have a lot of events for kids, like reading hours or crafting.
Just check out their website, the blackboard or ask the librarian.
