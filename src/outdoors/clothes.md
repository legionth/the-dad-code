## Sun hats

When it's sunny outside, you should protect your kids from the sun.
So use a sun hat, to avoid sunburns on the head and remember they are probably more active than you, so
they need more protection.

## Wet shoes

Puddles are unavoidable when you're outdoors.
And my kids love to jump in them.

So if your kids have wet shoes, you can put some newspaper in them.
The newspaper will absorb the moisture and the shoes will be dry mostly overnight.
The dirt can mostly be brushed off the next day.
