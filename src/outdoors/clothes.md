## Mud clothes

When you're outdoors, you can't avoid mud. Especially during the rainy seasons.
Your kids want and will get dirty, so to avoid an extra load of laundry you can dress them in mud clothes.
These consist of:

* mud pants
* mud jacket
* rubber boots

Often you can find these in the outdoor section of your local store.
They often come as a set and are easy to clean.
Just let them dry and brush off the dirt.

These clothes are supposed to be dirty, so don't waste time, money and your childs mood by putting them
into the washing machine after every use.

## Sun hats

When it's sunny outside, you should protect your kids from the sun.
So use a sun hat, to avoid sunburns on the head and remember they are probably more active than you, so
they need more protection.

## Wet shoes

Puddles are unavoidable when you're outdoors.
And my kids love to jump in them.

So if your kids have wet shoes, you can put some newspaper in them.
The newspaper will absorb the moisture and the shoes will be dry mostly overnight.
The dirt can mostly be brushed off the next day.
