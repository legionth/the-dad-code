# Investing

We want the best for our kids and this should also include finances.
By investing money, for them (not for me), I'll try to teach them about
saving money and earning money.

I'm not a financial advisor, but I try to learn as much as possible about investing.
And I want to pass this knowledge on to my kids as well.
In fact, I didn't understand investing until I became father in my 30s.
That is why I want to do it differently with my kids.
I want to teach them about investing and saving properly

The earlier you start investing, the better. So if you start as soon as they are born, you
can give your kids a good head start in life.

This is why a created a stock portfolio with ETFs for my kids.

## ETF Portfolio

ETF stands for Exchange Traded Fund and are widely used to invest in the stock market.
I do this for myself and as well for my kids. 

An ETF is a fund that holds a basket of assets, such as stocks, bonds, or commodities.
Which means that you can invest in a broad range of assets with just one ETF.

I have great experience with ETFs that track the MSCI World Index, but you have to do your own research.

There are ETFs for nearly every index, region, religion, sector or ethical standard.

I don't know if there are special ETF depots for kids in your country, but in Germany there are.
These called "Junior Depot" or "Kinderdepot" are special depots for kids, which means that the kids are the owners of the depot,
but the parents are the custodians.
So when the kids are of legal age, they can take over the depot.
That is why it's important to teach them about investing and saving money.
This depot is no surprise for them, they know about it and I try to teach them how to handle it.
