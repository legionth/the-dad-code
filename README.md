# The Dad Code

## Description

Hey everyone!

My name is Niels, and I'm a dad of two little boys.
I created this repository to share some knowledge I obtained and will obtain during my journey as a dad.
I'll update this repository with new information, experiences, and tips as my kids and I grow.
Mom's seem so connected through each other, but dads don't seem to have that same connection.
With this repository, I approach raising your kids from the software engineers perspective.
Everything Open Source, everything documented, everything shared.

I hope this repository will help you in your journey as a dad.
